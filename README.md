## Project Description
Since cyber security is becoming critical in our time, I chose the creation of the strong password generator as the project for myself. I want to have a deeper understanding of how I can create better passwords for increased protection. 

## Rules
The generator will create 12 character passwords randomizing from a list of letters, numbers, symbols, based on certain predefined constraints/requirements

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project:
Created the Trello Kanban board for planning the game
Created the Github repository
Plan: 
1.created and cloned the remote Github repository 
2. created .gitignore file
3. created and kept updating the README.md file
4. researched about the game - what crtieria/requirements should be set for the generator
5. designed the game structure/pseudocode
6. coded the game
7. checked the errors and corrected
8. tested the game
9. updated the Trello board with status of the plan
10. updated repository
11. created the presentation 

## Organization
I used the provided template of the Kanban board in Trello to keep track of the steps of the plan and going through the stages of To Do/Doing/Done

My repository has 1 readme file, 1 gitignore file and 1 game file. In the readme file I keep track of the high level details of the project, in the gitignore file I mention the types of documents that should be ignored when updating the repository, and in the game file I show the code used for the project.

Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
